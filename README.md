Setup
----------
This app is not currently available through any app store, so to run it, you'll have to get the .apk and install the app manually.

 1. Allow installation of apps from unknown sources.<br>
  a) Navigate to your phone's Settings.<br>
  b) Under "Personal," select "Security & Screen Lock".<br>
  c) Make sure the "Unknown sources" item is checked.<br>
 2. Download the .apk [here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css7209/Resources/Android/D2B-Android.apk) (this links to the latest version, though tags by version are also available [here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css7209/Resources/Android/Versions/).)<br>
  a) If you did this from your phone, you should be good to go! Skip to step #4.<br>
 3. If you did step #2 on your computer, you'll have to find a way to transfer the file from your computer to your phone. For information on how to do this, check out [this article](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2840804?hl=en).
 4. Once the .apk has been successfully downloaded onto your phone, simply open (touch/click on) the .apk to start the installation process!
