D2B-Android
===========

An Android app which takes user input in specified numerical format and displays as other types.

Handles Decimal (Natural Numbers) to Binary conversion, as well as Binary to Decimal conversion.

To operate, simply choose the data types (specifying both input and output -- default is Decimal to Binary, respectively) and enter your number into the text field available at the top of the app. Conversions happen dynamically and update immediately upon input changes, including changes to the specified input and/or output types.

Get it on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en)
----------
Production-ready versions will be published directly to the Play Store [right here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.css.d2bAndroid). It's free!<br>

Setup (Debugging - The Old Way to Install)
----------
Below describes the old way to access the app using the <code>.apk</code> files and by version. While I strongly encourage you to use the above method (simply grabbing it through the Play Store, where it is now published,) I will keep this section in for archival purposes.

 1. Allow installation of apps from unknown sources.<br>
  a) Navigate to your phone's Settings.<br>
  b) Under "Personal," select "Security & Screen Lock".<br>
  c) Make sure the "Unknown sources" item is checked.<br>
 2. Download the .apk [here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css7209/Resources/Android/D2B-Android.apk) (tags by version are also available [here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css7209/Resources/Android/Versions/).)<br>
  a) If you did this from your phone, you should be good to go! Skip to step #4.<br>
 3. If you did step #2 on your computer, you'll have to find a way to transfer the file from your computer to your phone. For information on how to do this, check out [this article](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2840804?hl=en).
 4. Once the .apk has been successfully downloaded onto your phone, simply open (touch/click on) the .apk to start the installation process!

Setup (Development)
----------
This section will detail how to set up your machine to develop and contribute to D2B. It's a relatively small project, so you - yes, <i>you</i> - could make a <b>big</b> impact! (Just submit a pull request!)

At this time, if you wish to work on the app, and are having trouble setting up your development environment, please contact me directly.
