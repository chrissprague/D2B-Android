D2B-Android
===========

An Android app which takes user input in specified numerical format and displays as other types.

Handles Decimal (Natural Numbers) to Binary conversion, as well as Binary to Decimal conversion.

To operate, simply choose the data types (specifying both input and output -- default is Decimal to Binary, respectively) and enter your number into the text field available at the top of the app. Conversions happen dynamically and update immediately upon input changes, including changes to the specified input and/or output types.

Setup
----------
This app is not currently available through any app store, so to run it, you'll have to get the .apk and install the app manually.

 1. Allow installation of apps from unknown sources.<br>
  a) Navigate to your phone's Settings.<br>
  b) Under "Personal," select "Security & Screen Lock".<br>
  c) Make sure the "Unknown sources" item is checked.<br>
 2. Download the .apk [here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css7209/Resources/Android/D2B-Android.apk) (tags by version are also available [here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css7209/Resources/Android/Versions/).)<br>
  a) If you did this from your phone, you should be good to go! Skip to step #4.<br>
 3. If you did step #2 on your computer, you'll have to find a way to transfer the file from your computer to your phone. For information on how to do this, check out [this article](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2840804?hl=en).
