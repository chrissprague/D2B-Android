Hello, everyone! My name is Christopher Sprague, and my presentation for 
you all today will be on the topic of one of my personal projects, an 
Android app I've named \emph{D2B-Android}. The premise of the app, which I will
go over in more depth shortly, is primarily to take user input in the
form of numbers written in standard decimal format, and convert the provided 
number into its corresponding binary value. As you'll notice, this is an 
open source project published on my GitHub, which you may access using the 
link shown. And, for the record, the script I'm reading from \emph{is} written 
in \TeX{}, and also happens to be available within the aforementioned repo.
